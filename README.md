# StuPlayer
StuPlayer is a simple music player I wrote to help me organise my music collection.
It is currently for macOS only, although I may port it to iOS at some point.

You need to be using m3u files and have your music in sub-folders based on type, artist, and album.
If you can do that, it works really well!

StuPlayer is available in the Apple store, so that is the best place to get it and try it.
Alternatively, you can build it yourself, but you will have to get the SFBAudioEngine first.
Copy the StuPlayer folder into SFBAudioEngine, and then open and build the app.
